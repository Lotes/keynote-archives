# keynote-archives

Contains code to process Keynote Archives.

Protobuf files were taken from  [psobot](https://github.com/psobot) / [keynote-parser](https://github.com/psobot/keynote-parser).

Read more about the iWorkArchive format [here](https://github.com/obriensp/iWorkFileFormat).

Generated by Keynote version 12.2.1 (current as of December 2022).

## How to use?

```
npm install keynote-archives
```

Then import the package and unzip the inner files, unchunk the single IWA files and split each chunk into objects.

```ts
import { isIwaFile, unzip, unchunk, splitObjects, serialize } from 'keynote-archives';

export async function decode(data: Uint8Array): void {
  for await(const entry of unzip(data)) {
    if(isIwaFile(entry.name)) {
      for await(const chunk of unchunk(entry.data)) {
        for await(const message of splitObjects(chunk)) {
          console.log(serialize(message));
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Documentation

This package provides asynchronous functions to read IWA format:

1. `unzip`: opens an Uint8 array as Zip file and returns multiple file entries, until EOF.
2. `unchunk`: opens an Uint8 array as IWA file and returns multiple [Snappy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snappy) uncompressed chunks as Uint8 array, until EOF.
3. `splitObjects`: opens an Uint8 array as IWA file chunk and returns multiple Protobuf-decoded IWA (JSON) objects, until EOF or error.
4. `decode`: (everything at once) opens an Uint8 array as Zip file and returns multiple `ArchiveEntry`s containing either a file or a list of IWA chunks with multiple IWA objects associated with an IWA file.

You will also get access to all archives types:

* `AllArchives` is a list of all archives.
* for each Protobuf package `XXX`, you will get:
  * a list of all package-related archives `XXX$Archives`
  * a namespace `XXX` with all archives `XXX.yyy`
* a map for all Keynote archives by type number `KeynoteArchives`
